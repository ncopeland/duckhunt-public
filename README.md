- Better performance and scalability
- Supports concurrent access
- Requires `mysql-connector-python` package

### Database Setup
1. Run the database setup script:

sql_host = localhost
sql_port = 3306
sql_database = duckhunt
sql_user = duckhunt
sql_password = your_secure_password_here

## Game Mechanics

### Combat System
- **Spawn**: Random spawns per channel up to `max_ducks`; oldest duck is always targeted
- **Shoot or Befriend**: `!bang` applies accuracy/reliability; `!bef` uses befriending accuracy
- **Miss Penalties**: Random -1 to -5 XP for misses; wild fire adds -2 XP
- **Accidental Shooting**: Wild fire (50% chance) and ricochet (20% chance) can hit other players
- **Insurance**: Life insurance prevents confiscation; liability insurance halves penalties

### Item System
- **Loot on Kill (10%)**: Weighted random loot; common/uncommon/rare/junk; durations mostly 24h
- **Shop Items**: 23 different items with various effects and durations
- **Consumables**: Do not stack; must be used up before buying again; shown in `!duckstats`
- **Upgrades**: Magazine capacity upgrades with dynamic pricing (5 levels max)

### Detection Systems
- **Ducks Detector**: 60s pre-spawn notice while active (24h)
- **Infrared Detector**: `!bang` with no duck is safely locked; limited uses (6 uses/24h)
- **Golden Duck Detection**: Revealed on first hit or befriend attempt

### Leveling & Stats
- **XP System**: Base XP + bonuses; level-based accuracy, reliability, clip size
- **Karma Tracking**: Good/bad actions tracked with karma percentage
- **Promotion/Demotion**: Automatic level change announcements
- **Channel-Specific**: All stats are tracked per channel

## Configuration

The bot uses `duckhunt.conf` for all settings with multi-network support:

- **IRC Connection**: Server, SSL, nickname, channels, perform commands
- **Game Settings**: Spawn timing, XP values, duck limits, despawn times
- **Permissions**: Owner and admin lists per network
- **Shop Prices**: All 23 shop item prices (can be overridden per network)
- **Backward Compatibility**: Falls back to global settings if network-specific not found
